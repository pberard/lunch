                                 The BIG TODO

So far, we can detect where a user is or let them specify a location.  If 
none is specified, it will default to chicago.  Users can search by
entering a term in the box or by checking boxes.  Eventually, I want them
to be able to enter what they DON'T want.  To do this, I'll have a list
of all the types of food we will search by, and then when users check boxes, 
those options will be removed from the query.

The app needs to be prettier as well.

I've made the app a bit nicer to look at and changed up some formatting.
Now, the user can choose how they search for lunch.  I need to add in the 
functionality for blacklisting lunch options.  Then, I want to limit the 
search results so that they only show one at a time.  The user will have to 
click to get to the next result if they don't like the first one.

Noticed that if we try to search for too many things at once, yelp throws an
exception saying that one of the parameters was wrong.  I think if the total
number of characters in the search 'term' exceeds 50 this will happen (around 
50ish, maybe a little over).  I wanted to do a subset of the user's selection
anyway, so now I just take 5 random things (if we even have that many) and 
run with those.

Next time, add logging
Avoid getting grocery stores as recommendations? Change category back to 
restaurant?

Added some logging, room for improvement. Changed category filter back to 
restaurants.

Next time, change the display so you can click 'next' through the top 10 
results.  Look into changing the category filter based on type of restaurant
given the whitelist/blacklist.

Added a next button and the ability to click through each result on the page.
Cleaned stuff up in lunchapp.rb.
